        <h1>New & improved Chicken Parmesan</h1>
        <img src ="https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/8848174.jpg" alt="adorable piece of chicken parmesan" style="height:300px"></a>
        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><em>From cook's notes</em></p>
            <p>The creamy ricotta makes a great base into which you could add any melting cheese.<br>
            Cheddar is a favorite choice by the original chef and recommends other options such as<br>provolone, fontina, 
            or even gruyere. And of course, if you prefer the tender meat of baby cows,<br>this technique will work just
             the same with veal.
            </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Large skinless, boneless chicken breat halves</li>
            <li>&#189; teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>&#189; cup flour</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>&#190; cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>&#189; cup light olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cheese spread:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>&#189; cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>&#189; cup shredded sharp white cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>&#189; teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Raggiano cheese for topping</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>To serve:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup marinara sauce, heated, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li></p>
            <p><li>Gently pound chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic until each breast is evenly thick. Place <br>&thinsp;breasts on a plate and season 1 side with kosher salt and black pepper. Sprinkle with flour; press <br>&thinsp;flour to coat the entire surface and help it adhere. Turn and repeat on second side with salt, pepper, and flour.</li></p>
            <p><li>Brush excess flour from plate; place the chicken breasts back on the plate. Pour beaten egg over the breasts <br>&thinsp;and coat each side. Cover bottom of a second plate with half the bread crumbs. Transfer chicken to the bread crumbs.<br>&thinsp;Push crumbs up sides of chicken. Sprinkle on the remaining crumbs and thoroughly coat each side.</li></p>
            <p><li>Heat &#189; inch olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until crispy and golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.</li></p>
            <p><li>Mix ricotta and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl. Stir in salt, black pepper, cayenne, and olive oil. Spread half the cheese mixture on each breast without<br>&thinsp;extending all the way to the edges. Dust with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and drizzle with olive oil.</li></p>
            <p><li>Bake on center rack of preheated oven until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes.<br>&thinsp;An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li></p>
            <p><li>To serve, ladle the heated marinara sauce in a wide circle on warm plates. Place chicken in center and sprinkle with chopped parsley.</li></p>
        </ol>
